# mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator
Completed in part for the freeCodeCamp.org Data Analysis with Python course.

## What does it do?
This is a function that uses numpy to calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix. The function outputs this information as a dictionary, where the values are lists containing the calculations for the columns, rows, and entire array. The function only takes in a list of nine elements; any other number of elements returns a value error.
